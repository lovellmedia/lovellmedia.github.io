      really a 50% chance that someone you care 
      about and love is an afternoon's drive away. BV: Well, yea 
      obviously there is 
      always that big city vibe. to accomplish I spent their 
      youth in Frederick so amaze 
      I drove into Chicago I drove across the Queensboro Bridge by 
      accident and was scared coming 
      from my mind (laughs). 
      I come from Frederick County man! I really 
      didn't know what I getting at. But that all changed with experience and 
      living there which is a much wider city, and there dining is often a 
      part of life. It is not 
      just entertainment because there isn't a choice, people can't really cook at home. Many of the historical 
      events that occurred at Camp David are displayed in news clippings in 
      the one-room memorial. Each 
      president has a section of your museum where photos, artifacts and ephemera 
      put a spotlight on key events or moments of rest at nearby Camp 
      Bob. Although President Obama 
      and his family have often visited Camp David since January's 
      Inauguration, their prominently located perhaps the museum really is as of yet an unwritten slate.

      of the local. The 
      town should be only between Breton Bay and St. 
      Marys River State Park. It's a unique and 
      exquisite part within the US. BV: To 
      start with thing that this is has been doing for us 
      here, will be the we have a lot of 
      transient business on weekends from Baltimore and F.C. and they recognize me from while i was at Charlie Palmer Steak. Therefore i had very much of former 
      clientele would you 
      come high on 
      the saturdays. But the local support I assume was as strong whilst it could have or 
      need to have been up 
      until show 
      aired. Now we have a group that's behind us around the show the actual we've done and that's exciting. Being able to follow the street and 
      walk downtown and provide people marked on your 
      calender is 
      wonderful. I was 
      recently fortunate to pay a 
      visit to Volt and was treated using 
      a wonderful meal and great 
      service. An amount 
      you say you're the most proud of with your restaurant? You mentioned the bad economy 
      whenever you first showed 
      around July of throughout. were there any major hiccups within the way or did you think it can't 
      work away from?
